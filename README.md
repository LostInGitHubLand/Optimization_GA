**The aim of this work**
This work was produced during a job interview in which I was given a small dataset and some basic knowledge on genetic algorithms, which I didn't know before, to solve a knapsack problem. The aim of the test was to approach a new topic (without getting lost in the details) and learn in a few days how to manage it to best solve the given task and find an optimal solution. 
It was fun, I love learning new things, even if I struggle not to get sucked into curiosity and get lost in the details.

## Overview of Genetic Algorithms

**Inventor**: John Holland, a professor at the University of Michigan, is widely credited with developing the foundational concepts of genetic algorithms in the 1960s and 1970s.   
**Core Concept**: Genetic algorithms are inspired by the process of natural selection in biological evolution. They work by mimicking the principles of:
**Selection**: Choosing the "fittest" individuals (solutions) from a population based on their performance.   
**Crossover**: Combining parts of two "parent" solutions to create "offspring" with potentially improved characteristics.   
**Mutation**: Introducing random changes to the offspring to explore new areas of the solution space.   
  
**Strengths**:
- *Robustness*: Can handle complex, non-linear, and multi-modal optimization problems.   
- *Global Search*: Explore a wide range of solutions and avoid getting stuck in local optima.   
- *Parallelism*: Can be easily parallelized for faster execution on multi-core processors or distributed systems.   
- *Flexibility*: Applicable to a wide range of problems in various fields.   
**Weaknesses**:
- *Slow Convergence*: Can be slower than other optimization methods for some problems.   
- *Parameter Tuning*: Finding optimal parameter settings (population size, mutation rate, etc.) can be challenging.
- *Premature Convergence*: The population may converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution.   
- *Fields of Application*

**Optimization**:
- *Engineering design* (e.g., aircraft design, material selection)   
- *Financial modeling* (e.g., portfolio optimization, risk management)   
- *Machine learning* (e.g., feature selection, neural network training)   
**Artificial Intelligence**:
- *Evolutionary computation*
- *Genetic programming*
**Other Areas**:
- *Scheduling and logistics*   
- *Robotics*   
  - *Bioinformatics*
